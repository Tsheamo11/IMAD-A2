The Flashcard App
You're creating an Android app using Kotlin, and its main job is to help people learn and remember stuff. Think of it as your personal quiz master, but on your phone!

What's the Big Idea?
This app is all about making learning stick. You'll get True/False questions, and right after you answer, the app tells you if you got it right or wrong. It's like having an instant tutor! Once you're done with all five questions, you'll see your score and get some friendly feedback. It's designed to be super easy to use, helping you practice and really get a feel for what you know and what you need to improve. It's built with modern Android tech, so it's smooth and reliable.

How it is designed
When you built this app, you clearly thought about making it user-friendly and clear. Here's how:
Making it Look Good & Feel Right

You've planned out different screens, each with its own role:
The Welcoming: When you first open the app, you're greeted with a simple welcome message and a quick description of what the app does. There's a big "Start Quiz" button, so you know exactly how to dive in. It's all about making a good first impression and guiding you right away.
The Quiz Hot Seat: This is where the everything happens. A big, clear question pops up, and you've got two obvious buttons: "True" and "False." As soon as you pick an answer, you get instant feedback – a "Correct!" in green or an "Incorrect!" in red. You can't accidentally skip ahead because the "Next" button only lights up once you've made your choice. It's designed to keep you focused on each question and give you that immediate good impression.
The Scoreboard: After all the questions, you land here. It shows you your final score (like, "You got 4 out of 5!"), and gives you some personalized praise or encouragement. You've also included a "Review Answers" button (a smart move for deeper learning!) and a straightforward "Exit App" button to close everything down neatly. It's a quick way to end the quiz, giving you the full picture of how you did.
The Review: If you hit that "Review Answers" button, you'd go to a screen that lists all the questions again, along with their correct answers. 
Keeping it easy and a better way of understanding
You focused on making the app easy to pick up and use – no complicated instructions needed. Getting that instant feedback is key for learning, and you made sure the "Next" button only works when it should, so no accidental skips. You've also used Kotlin, which is a great, modern language for Android, making your code clean and sturdy. The way you organized your questions and moved between screens is super easy.

GitHub & GitHub Actions
You're not just building an app; you're using professional tools to make sure it's built well and efficiently!
GitHub: Your Code's Home Base
Think of GitHub as your app's digital locker room. It's where all your app's code lives, safely stored and organized.
Tracking Every Change: Every litte things or big new feature you add to your code is recorded. So, if something breaks, you can easily go back to an earlier, working version.
Open and Accessible: Your code is hosted online, so you can get to it from anywhere.

GitHub Actions:
Instant Builds: Every time you push new code to GitHub, your robot assistant automatically tries to build your app. This means it compiles your code and checks for errors.
Catching Problems Early: If you accidentally make a mistake in your code, GitHub Actions will immediately flag it. You'll know something's wrong right away, not later when it's a bigger mess to fix. This saves you a lots of time.
Always Ready: Because it's constantly building and checking, you can be confident that your project is always in a good state.
